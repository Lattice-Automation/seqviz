### Features

#### Linear and/or Circular sequence viewer

- Annotations with names and colors
- Amino acid translations
- Enzyme cut sites
- Searching and highlighting

#### Sequence and element selection

- Selecting a sequence range -- or clicking an `annotation`, `translation`, `enzyme` or `searchElement` -- will highlight that section of the viewer(s) and pass the selection to the `onSelection()` callback

## Usage

### Installation

#### npm

```bash
npm install seqviz
```

#### CDN

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/seqviz"></script>
```

### Instantiation

#### React

```jsx
import { SeqViz } from "seqviz";

export default () => (
  <SeqViz
    name="J23100"
    seq="TTGACGGCTAGCTCAGTCCTAGGTACAGTGCTAGC"
    annotations={[{ name: "promoter", start: 0, end: 34, direction: 1, color: "blue" }]}
  />
);
```

#### Non-React

More details are in the [Viewer without React](#viewer-without-react) section.

```html
<script>
  window.seqviz
    .Viewer("root", {
      name: "L09136",
      seq: "tcgcgcgtttcggtgatgacggtgaaaacctctgacacatgca",
      style: { height: "100vh", width: "100vw" },
    })
    .render();
</script>
```

### Props

All the following are usable as props for the React component (`seqviz.SeqViz`) or as options for the plain JS implementation (`seqviz.Viewer()`).

#### Required

#### `seq (='')`

A sequence to render. Can be a DNA, RNA, or amino acid sequence.

##### File or Accession

There are `@deprecated` props -- `file` and `accession` -- that will be parsed to `seq` and `annotations` props. But we recommend doing that outside of `SeqViz` with [the `seqparse` package](https://github.com/Lattice-Automation/seqparse). For example:

```jsx
import seqparse from "seqparse";

export default () => {
  const [seq, setSeq] = useState(null);

  useEffect(async () => {
    setSeq(await seqparse("NC_011521"));
  });

  if (!seq) return null;

  return <SeqViz {...seq} />;
};
```

#### Optional

#### `viewer (='both')`

One of `"linear" | "circular" | "both" | "both_flip"`. The type and orientation of the sequence viewers. `both` means the circular viewer fills the left side of SeqViz and the linear viewer fills the right. `both_flip` is the opposite: the linear viewer is on the left and the circular viewer is on the right.

#### `name (='')`

The name of the sequence/plasmid. Shown at the center of the circular viewer.

#### `compSeq (='')`

The complement sequence. Inferred from `seq` by default.

#### `annotations (=[])`

An array of `annotations` to show. Each `Annotation` requires 0-based start (inclusive) and end (exclusive) indexes. For arrows, set the annotation's direction to `1` for forward arrows and `-1` for reverse arrows. Names are rendered on top of the annotation.

```js
annotations = [
  { start: 0, end: 22, name: "Strong promoter", direction: 1 }, // [0, 22)
  { start: 23, end: 273, name: "GFP" },
  { start: 300, end: 325, name: "Weak promoter", direction: -1, color: "#FAA887" },
];
```

In the example above, the "Strong promoter" would span the first to twenty-second basepair.

#### `translations (=[])`

An array of `translations` showing amino acids beneath a DNA sequence. Requires 0-based `start` (inclusive) and `end` (exclusive) indexes relative the DNA sequence. A
direction is required: 1 (FWD) or -1 (REV).

```js
translations = [
  { start: 0, end: 90, direction: 1 }, // [0, 90)
  { start: 191, end: 522, direction: -1 },
];
```

#### `enzymes (=[])`

An array of restriction `enzymes` to show the recognition sites for. A list of pre-defined enzymes in [src/enzymes.ts](src/enzymes.ts) can be referenced by name. Example:

```js
enzymes = [
  "EcoRI",
  "PstI",
  {
    name: "Cas9",
    rseq: "NGG", // recognition sequence
    fcut: 0, // cut index on FWD strand, relative to start of rseq
    rcut: 1, // cut index on REV strand, relative to start of rseq
    color: "#D7E5F0", // color to highlight recognition site with
  },
];
```

Enzymes can be limited to a range via the `range` property on an `Enzyme` object:

```js
enzymes = [
  {
    name: "Cas9",
    rseq: "NGG", // recognition sequence
    fcut: 0, // cut index on FWD strand, relative to start of rseq
    rcut: 1, // cut index on REV strand, relative to start of rseq
    color: "#D7E5F0", // color to highlight recognition site with
    // only show recognition sites between 100th and 250th index [100,250]
    range: {
      start: 100,
      end: 250,
    },
  },
];
```

#### `highlights (=[])`

Ranges of the sequence to highlight. A default color from `colors` is used if none is provided.

```js
highlights = [
  { start: 36, end: 66, color: "magenta" },
  { start: 70, end: 80 },
];
```

#### `zoom (={ linear: 50 })`

How zoomed the viewer(s) should be `0-100`. Key'ed by viewer type (`viewer`). `circular` used to be but isn't presently supported.

#### `colors (=[])`

An array of colors to use for annotations, translations, and highlights. Defaults to:

```js
colors = [
  "#9DEAED", // cyan
  "#8FDE8C", // green
  "#CFF283", // light green
  "#8CDEBD", // teal
  "#F0A3CE", // pink
  "#F7C672", // orange
  "#F07F7F", // red
  "#FAA887", // red-orange
  "#F099F7", // magenta
  "#C59CFF", // purple
  "#6B81FF", // blue
  "#85A6FF", // light blue
];
```

#### `bpColors (={})`

An object that maps basepairs to their color. The key/bp is either a nucleotide type or 0-based index. Example:

```js
bpColors = { A: "#FF0000", T: "blue", 12: "#00FFFF" };
```

#### `style (={})`

Style for `seqviz`'s outer container div. Empty by default. Useful for setting the height and width of the viewer if the element around `seqviz` lacks a defined height and/or width. For example:

```js
style = { height: "100vh", width: "100vw" };
```

#### `onSelection (=null)`

Callback function executed after selection events. Should accept a single `selection` argument: `(selection) => {}`.

This occurs after drag/drop selection and clicks. If an `annotation`, `translation`, `enzyme` or `searchElement` was
clicked, the `selection` object will have info on the selected element. The example below is of a `selection` object
following an `annotation` click.

```js
{
  // selection
  "name": "lacZ fragment",
  "type": "ANNOTATION",
  "seq": "ctatgcggcatcagagcagattgtactgagagtgcaccatatgcggtgtgaaataccgcacagatgcgtaaggagaaaataccgcatcaggcgccattcgccattcaggctgcgcaactgttgggaagggcgatcggtgcgggcctcttcgctattacgccagctggcgaaagggggatgtgctgcaaggcgattaagttgggtaacgccagggttttcccagtcacgacgttgtaaaacgacggccagtgccaagcttgcatgcctgcaggtcgactctagaggatccccgggtaccgagctcgaattcgtaatcatggtcat",
  "gc": 55.3,
  "tm": 85,
  "start": 133,
  "end": 457,
  "length": 324,
  "direction": -1
  "clockwise": true,
  "color": "#8FDE8C",
}
```

#### `search (=null)`

A `search` object for specifying search results to highlight on the viewer. An example is below:

```js
search = { query: "aatggtctc", mismatch: 1 };
```

Searching supports the following nucleotide wildcards within the `query`.

```js
{
  "y": ["c", "t"],
  "r": ["a", "g"],
  "w": ["a", "t"],
  "s": ["c", "g"],
  "k": ["g", "t"],
  "m": ["a", "c"],
  "d": ["a", "g", "t"],
  "v": ["a", "c", "g"],
  "h": ["a", "c", "t"],
  "b": ["c", "g", "t"],
  "x": ["a", "c", "g", "t"],
  "n": ["a", "c", "g", "t"]
}
```

`mismatch` is an `int` denoting the maximum allowable mismatch between the query and a match within the viewer's
sequence (see: [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)).

#### `onSearch (=null)`

Callback executed after a search event with a `searchResults` object. Called once on initial render. An example of `searchResults` is below:

```js
[
  {
    start: 728,
    end: 733,
    direction: 1,
    index: 0,
  },
  {
    start: 1788,
    end: 1793,
    direction: -1,
    index: 1,
  },
];
```

#### `copyEvent (=(e: KeyboardEvent) => e => e.key === "c" && (e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey))`

A functions that returns whether to copy the selected range on the viewer(s) to the [user's clipboard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Interact_with_the_clipboard). The default method copies sequence after any `ctrl+c` or `meta+c` keyboard events.

#### `showComplement (=true)`

Whether to show the complement sequence.

#### `showIndex (=true)`

Whether to show the index line and ticks below the sequence.

#### `rotateOnScroll (=true)`

The circular viewer rotates when scrolling over the viewer by default. That can be disabled with `rotateOnScroll: false`.

### Viewer without React

For usability in non-React apps, we provide a thin wrapper around the React component. The viewer's constructor accepts two arguments:

- `element`: either an element id or an element, e.g. from `document.getElementById()`
- `props`: props as documented [above](#optionsprops)

```js
const element = document.getElementById("root");
const viewer = seqviz.Viewer(element, props);
// Render the viewer to the DOM at the node passed in $element`.
viewer.render();
// To later update the viewer's configuration and re-renders.
viewer.setState(props);
// To render the viewer, eg for server-side rendering, and returns it as an HTML string.
viewer.renderToString();
```
